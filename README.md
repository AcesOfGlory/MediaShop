## Problem Statement

For this assignment you need to build a web interface for the Film Sales Service. The interface will allow customers to browse the films that are available for purchase on line, with a view to purchasing one or more of the films. Before a purchase is made the customer must login so theycan make a payment using their existing credit card details. For new customers they must register with the sales service before they can make a purchase. 
Existing customers can edit their details.

As such, the required functionality is as follows:
- A new customer should be registered (Registration should comply with the data structure of the database).
- A customer can purchase a film (Relevant data should be inserted into the database and the database updated).
- Customers can edit their personal and account details (i.e. change address, password).
- Customers can view all their past purchases.
